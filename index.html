                This project features an API built with Laravel that is consumed by a React front end.  The name of the game here is to automate as much of the day to day operations as possible.

            <h3 class="project-title">Dvlop</h3>
            <p class="project-text">
                Dvlop has built a new platform from the ground up, the hard way, one camera at a time. They have re-imagined presets as they should be - a tool that not only speeds up work flows, but one that also spurs creativity.
            </p>
            <p class="project-text">
                Dvlop features a Laravel backend and good a ol' HTML, SCSS and Javascript front end.  This was my first large project and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out. I was integral in building and testing every aspect of the backend.  From purchase flow, coupon logic, Oauth and an admin panel, I had the opportunity to do it all.  I absolutely loved this project.
